There are four accounts used in the code in hello_world.ts in lesson4_helloworld project:
1. payer - This is the keypair associated with the fees' payer. 
It is generated in the establishPayer function and is used to pay 
for the transactions that interact with the program.

2. programId - This is the public key of the deployed hello world 
program. It is read from the keypair file in the checkProgram function.

3. greetedPubkey - This is the public key of the account we are saying 
hello to. It is derived from the program's public key, the payer's 
public key, and a seed string in the checkProgram function.

4. GreetingAccount - This is the state of a greeting account managed by 
the hello world program. It is defined as a class in the code and is 
used in the GreetingSchema Map to define the Borsh schema for greeting accounts.

In the break.ts code in break project, 
we have accounts which is a collection of Solana accounts, 
and includes feePayerKeypairs and programAccounts.

1. feePayerKeypairs is an array of keypairs that are used to pay transaction 
fees on the Solana network. Each keypair includes a public key and a secret key.

2. programAccounts is an array of public keys representing accounts associated 
with a Solana program. These accounts can be used for storing data or state 
related to a program.

Transaction is a function that changes the state of accounts in the Solana blockchain.
Each transaction consists of a sequence of instructions, each of which specifies how 
to update the state of one or more accounts. An account in Solana is similar to an 
account in a traditional bank. It has an owner, a balance, and can hold state data.

In hello_world.ts in lesson4-helloworld project, there are several transactions that 
interact with different accounts on the Solana blockchain. Here is a breakdown of the 
transactions and accounts in the code:

1. The requestAirdrop transaction: This transaction requests a transfer of SOL (the native 
token of the Solana blockchain) to the payer account. This transaction is initiated by 
calling the requestAirdrop method of the Connection object, passing in the payer account's 
public key and the amount of SOL to transfer. The confirmTransaction method is called to wait
for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.

2. The createAccount transaction: This transaction creates a new account on the blockchain to 
store the state of the GreetingAccount object. The TransactionInstruction object specifies 
that a new account should be created with the SystemProgram.createAccount method, passing in 
the greetedPubkey as the new account's public key, the payer account as the owner of the new 
account, and the GREETING_SIZE constant as the size of the new account.

3. The initializeAccount transaction: This transaction initializes the new account created in 
the previous transaction with the state of the GreetingAccount object. 
The TransactionInstruction object specifies that the new account should be initialized with 
the programId as the program to use to initialize the account, the greetedPubkey as the 
account to initialize, and the payer account as the owner of the account.

4. The incrementCounter transaction: This transaction updates the state of the 
GreetingAccount object by incrementing its counter field. The TransactionInstruction object 
specifies that the programId should be used to update the greetedPubkey account, passing in 
the payer account as the owner of the account, and the borsh.serialize method to serialize 
the new state of the GreetingAccount object.

4. The sayHello transaction: This transaction reads the state of the GreetingAccount object 
and logs a message to the console. The TransactionInstruction object specifies that the 
programId should be used to read the state of the greetedPubkey account, passing in the payer 
account as the owner of the account, and the SystemProgram.programId method to indicate that 
no update to the account is necessary.

Each transaction in Solana requires a fee to be paid in SOL to the validators that process the transaction. The payer account is used to pay the fees for all transactions in the code.
createTransaction is a function that takes in the necessary parameters for creating and sending a transaction. It uses a web worker (CreateTransactionRPC) to generate a signed transaction, and then sends the transaction to the Solana network using a WebSocket. The function also dispatches actions to a Redux store to track the progress of the transaction, such as whether it has been confirmed or timed out.

And in the break.ts in break project, createTransaction is a function that takes in the 
necessary parameters for creating and sending a transaction. It uses a web worker 
(CreateTransactionRPC) to generate a signed transaction, and then sends the transaction 
to the Solana network using a WebSocket. The function also dispatches actions to a Redux 
store to track the progress of the transaction, such as whether it has been confirmed or 
timed out.
